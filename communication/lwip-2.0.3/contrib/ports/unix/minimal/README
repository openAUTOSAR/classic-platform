This is an example of a very minimal lwIP project. It runs in a single
thread and runs a single example application - an echo server. The
echo application is implemented using the raw API. Additionally this
raw API example hosts the SNMPv1 agent for development purposes.

In order to run the demo without root priviledges, you can create a
preconfigured tap device in advance and then run the application with the
interface passed in via an environment variable:

$ sudo ip tuntap add dev tap0 mode tap user YOUR-USER-NAME
$ sudo ip a a dev tap0 192.168.0.1/24
$ PRECONFIGURED_TAPIF=tap0 ./echop
